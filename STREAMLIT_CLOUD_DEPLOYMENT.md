# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ Issue: NumPy Compatibility Error

The error you're encountering is due to a NumPy version compatibility issue with OpenCV on Streamlit Cloud:

```
ImportError: This app has encountered an error.
File "/mount/src/yolo-video-object-detection/streamlit_app.py", line 2, in <module>
    import cv2
```

## 🔧 Solution: Use Fixed Version

### **1. Use the Fixed Streamlit App**

Instead of `streamlit_app.py`, use `streamlit_app_fixed.py` which:
- ✅ **No OpenCV dependency** - Avoids NumPy compatibility issues
- ✅ **Uses ultralytics directly** - More reliable on Streamlit Cloud
- ✅ **Same functionality** - All features preserved
- ✅ **Better performance** - Optimized for cloud deployment

### **2. Update Your Streamlit Cloud Configuration**

#### **Option A: Change Main File**
In your Streamlit Cloud settings, change the main file from:
```
streamlit_app.py
```
to:
```
streamlit_app_fixed.py
```

#### **Option B: Rename Files**
Rename the files in your repository:
```bash
# Rename the problematic file
mv streamlit_app.py streamlit_app_old.py

# Rename the fixed file to be the main file
mv streamlit_app_fixed.py streamlit_app.py
```

### **3. Use Streamlit-Specific Requirements**

Use `requirements_streamlit.txt` instead of `requirements.txt`:

```txt
ultralytics>=8.0.0
streamlit>=1.25.0
plotly>=5.0.0
pillow>=9.0.0
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0
numpy>=1.21.0,<2.0.0
pandas>=1.5.0
```

Select one of these apps as your main file:
- `streamlit_app_fixed.py` (recommended)
- `streamlit_app_simple.py`
- `streamlit_app_with_logo.py`
- `streamlit_excavator.py`

### **Step 2: Update Requirements**
Use `requirements_streamlit.txt` in your Streamlit Cloud settings.

### **Step 3: Configure Streamlit**
Use the `.streamlit/config.toml` file for optimal settings.

### **Step 4: Deploy**
1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Streamlit Cloud
3. Set the main file to your chosen app
4. Deploy

## 🔍 Why This Happens

### **NumPy 2.x Compatibility Issue**
- OpenCV was compiled with NumPy 1.x
- Streamlit Cloud uses NumPy 2.x
- This creates a compatibility conflict
- The error is redacted for security reasons

### **Solution Benefits**
- ✅ **No compatibility issues** - Uses compatible libraries
- ✅ **Faster deployment** - No OpenCV compilation needed
- ✅ **Better reliability** - Fewer dependency conflicts
- ✅ **Same functionality** - All features preserved

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| App | OpenCV | NumPy Compatible | Features | Cloud Ready |

streamlit_app_fixed.py
```

### **For Construction Equipment**
```bash
# Use the excavator app
streamlit_excavator.py
```

### **For Professional Branding**
```bash
# Use the logo app
streamlit_app_with_logo.py
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If You Still Get Errors**

1. **Check Requirements**
   - Use `requirements_streamlit.txt`
   - Ensure NumPy version is `<2.0.0`

2. **Clear Cache**
   - In Streamlit Cloud, clear the app cache
   - Redeploy the application

3. **Check File Paths**
   - Ensure all files are in the correct location
   - Check for any missing dependencies

4. **Use Simple App**
   - If issues persist, use `streamlit_app_simple.py`
   - This has minimal dependencies
